## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### Asteroid Splitting System
- **Large asteroids** (radius 60) → Split into 2 medium asteroids (radius 40)
- **Medium asteroids** (radius 40) → Split into 2 small asteroids (radius 20)  
- **Small asteroids** (radius 20) → Destroyed completely

### Physics
- **Frame-rate independent movement** using delta time
- **Momentum-based spaceship controls**
- **Vector-based velocity calculations**
- **Smooth rotation and movement**

### Collision Detection
- **Circle-to-circle collision** for precise hit detection
- **Player vs Asteroids** → Game Over
- **Bullets vs Asteroids** → Asteroid splits/destruction

## 🔧 Configuration

Game settings can be modified in `constants.py`:

```python
# Screen settings
SCREEN_WIDTH = 1280
SCREEN_HEIGHT = 720

# Player settings  
PLAYER_SPEED = 200
PLAYER_TURN_SPEED = 300
PLAYER_SHOOT_SPEED = 500
PLAYER_SHOOT_COOLDOWN = 0.3

# Asteroid settings
ASTEROID_MIN_RADIUS = 20
ASTEROID_SPAWN_RATE = 0.8
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

The game follows object-oriented design principles:

- **`CircleShape`** - Base class providing collision detection and sprite management
- **`Player`** - Handles user input, movement, rotation, and shooting
- **`Asteroid`** - Individual asteroid behavior and splitting mechanics  
- **`Shot`** - Bullet physics and movement
- **`AsteroidField`** - Procedural asteroid spawning system

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Bullets may occasionally pass through very small asteroids at high speeds
- No boundary wrapping (objects disappear when leaving screen edges)
- No scoring system implemented yet

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Score tracking and high scores
- [ ] Sound effects and background music
- [ ] Screen wrapping for player and asteroids
- [ ] Power-ups (rapid fire, shield, etc.)
- [ ] Multiple lives system
- [ ] UFO enemies
- [ ] Particle effects for explosions
- [ ] Menu system with pause functionality
